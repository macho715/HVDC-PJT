# HVDC Project Material Logistics Flow & Routewise Inventory â€“ Final Report

---

## 1. Project Overview

This report provides a consolidated summary and analytics of material logistics for the HVDC project, covering all flows from port arrival to final site installation (both inland and island/offshore).  
**Objective:** To systematically track stock locations, movement routes, real-time inventory status, and "Pre Arrival" items, enabling early detection of bottlenecks and risks and supporting optimal project progress.

---

## 2. Logistics Flow Codes â€“ Definitions

Each "code" (0~4) below represents **the total number of logistics handling steps (routing, warehousing, transfers) a material goes through before final arrival at site**.  
**Handling Quantity** indicates how many steps each material is processed, stored, or transferred prior to site delivery.

| Code | Logistics Route Definition                                | Handling Meaning                                                       |
|:----:|:--------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| 0    | Pre Arrival                                              | Not yet arrived in the logistics network; pending inbound or scanning  |
| 1    | Port â†’ Site                                              | Direct delivery from port to site (single handling step)               |
| 2    | Port â†’ WH (Warehouse) â†’ Site                             | Via one intermediate warehouse before site (two handling steps)        |
| 3    | Port â†’ WH â†’ MOSB (Offshore Base) â†’ Site (Island)         | Port â†’ warehouse â†’ offshore base â†’ island site (three handling steps)  |
| 4    | Port â†’ WH â†’ wh â†’ MOSB â†’ Site (Island, via multi-WH)      | Multiple warehouses â†’ offshore base â†’ island site (four steps)         |

> For example, **Code 3 (Handling=3)** means the item has been routed through three handling points (warehouse, offshore base, and island site) prior to installation.
>  
> These codes are essential for full traceability, bottleneck analysis, and optimizing cost & lead time in EPC mega-projects.

## 4. Data Traceability Logic

- **All materials are tracked for every step (Inbound â†’ Outbound â†’ Final Site Arrival):**
    - *Inbound (Arrival):* Arrival at warehouse or logistics base
    - *Outbound (Release):* Dispatched from warehouse or hub
    - *Site Arrival:* Receipt at final site or installation zone
- **Code 0 ("Pre Arrival"):** Items not yet processed by the logistics system, or pending scanning (163 items, 3%) â€“ **must be checked and reconciled with WMS/physical stock**
- **Codes 1â€“4:** Each item is assigned a "Logistics Flow Code" for automatic classification, route analysis, and management
- **This logic is a global EPC best practice for inventory, loss, and bottleneck management**

---

## 5. Routewise Insights & Risk Points

- **Portâ†’Site (1):**  
    - Fastest, lowest cost, high schedule risk if delivery is late (JIT, urgent items)
- **Portâ†’WHâ†’Site (2):**  
    - Typical for batch management, quality control; risk of warehouse bottleneck
- **Portâ†’WHâ†’MOSBâ†’Site (3):**  
    - For offshore/island sites, major risk is long-term storage at MOSB, sequence misalignment
- **Portâ†’WHâ†’whâ†’MOSBâ†’Site (4):**
    - Multi-warehouse routes, for special/large items â€“ traceability is crucial
- **Pre Arrival (0):**
    - ~3% of items; must be regularly audited to prevent loss or site delay

---

## 6. Action Plan â€“ For Project & Warehouse Teams

- **Pre Arrival items (163):** Immediate site/warehouse verification; update status in WMS/ERP
- **Routewise dashboard:** Automate KPI, lead time, and "Action Needed" lists by flow code and site/warehouse
- **Long-term inventory & bottleneck management:**  
    - Focus on MOSB and warehouse aged stock; real-time alerts for long-stay items
- **Automated bottleneck/loss/claim warnings:**  
    - Triggered for any over-KPI, unhandled, or delayed items

---

## 7. Additional Recommendations

- **Monthly route/site/category breakdown dashboards and reports**
- **Separate analysis for Pre Arrival, MOSB staging, and long-term stock**
- **Standardize use of Logistics Flow Codes in ERP/WMS and inventory apps for seamless tracking**
